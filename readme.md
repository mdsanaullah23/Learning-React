# My React Learning Journey

## Day One: Getting Started with React

### Overview
Today marked the beginning of my journey into the world of React. I explored the fundamentals, including setting up React applications using two methods: the traditional `create-react-app` approach and the faster alternative, Vite. Additionally, I delved into understanding React's file structure, creating custom React applications, and grasping the concept of React Hooks.

### Key Learnings
- **Creating React Apps:**
  - Explored the traditional method using `npm create-react-app`.
  - Discovered the faster alternative, Vite, for creating React applications.
- **Understanding File Structures:**
  - Analyzed the differences in file structure between applications created by `create-react-app` and Vite.
- **Creating Custom React Apps:**
  - Learned how to create a custom React app from scratch.
  - Implemented basic functionality such as creating React elements and printing "Hello, World!" to the screen.
- **Understanding React Hooks:**
  - Explored the concept of React Hooks, starting with `useState`.
  - Practiced implementing a simple counter application, updating its state with `useState` to increase and decrease the counter.

# React Learning Journey - Day Two

Welcome to day two of my React learning journey! In today's session, I explored the fundamentals of React, including the installation and configuration of Tailwind CSS, creating components, and understanding the concept of Props.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Day Two Highlights

### 1. Tailwind CSS Integration
I learned how to install and configure Tailwind CSS within my React project. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by providing a set of pre-defined utility classes.

### 2. Component Creation
I delved into creating components in React, which are reusable building blocks for constructing user interfaces. By breaking down the UI into components, I gained better organization and modularity in my React applications.

### 3. Understanding Props
Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components in React. I grasped the concept of Props and learned how to pass data between components to dynamically render content.


### Future Steps
- Explore more React and their applications.
- Dive deeper into React's ecosystem and best practices.
- Continue building and experimenting with React applications to solidify understanding.

- # React Learning Journey - Day Three

Welcome to day three of my React learning journey! Today, I worked on two projects: bgChanger and passwordGenerator. In addition to building these projects, I delved into the concepts of useCallback and useEffect in React.

## Projects Created
### 1. bgChanger
- Description: bgChanger is a simple React application that allows users to change the background color by clicking a button.
- Features:
  - Utilizes the useState hook to manage state.
  - Implements useCallback hook to optimize performance by memoizing a callback function.

### 2. passwordGenerator
- Description: passwordGenerator is a React application that generates random passwords based on user preferences.
- Features:
  - Utilizes the useState hook to manage state.
  - Implements useEffect hook to perform side effects such as updating the password when user preferences change.

## Concepts Explored
### 1. useCallback
- useCallback is a React hook used to memoize functions, which helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on these functions.

### 2. useEffect
- useEffect is a React hook used to perform side effects in function components. It allows us to perform actions such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM in a declarative way.

## Challenges Faced
While working on these projects and exploring the new concepts, I encountered challenges in understanding the nuances of when to use useCallback versus useMemo, and how to effectively manage side effects with useEffect. However, through experimentation and consulting documentation, I was able to overcome these hurdles and deepen my understanding.

## Future Steps
In the upcoming sessions, I plan to further enhance my understanding of React by exploring more advanced topics such as context API, Redux for state management, and integrating external APIs into my projects.

  # React Learning Journey - Days 4 to 12

Welcome to the collective update for days 4 to 12 of my React learning journey! Over the past nine days, I've made significant progress in my understanding of React and have built several projects showcasing different aspects of the framework.

## Topics Explored
### 1. React Router
- Leveraged React Router to enable navigation and routing within my applications. 
- Created a simple website with multiple pages and dynamic routing.

### 2. Fetching Data from GitHub API
- Utilized the Fetch API or Axios library to fetch data from the GitHub API.
- Integrated GitHub data into my projects, such as displaying user repositories or information.

### 3. Currency Converter Application
- Designed and implemented a currency converter application using React.
- Utilized external APIs to fetch live currency exchange rates and perform conversions.

### 4. API Context for Login Form
- Implemented API context to manage user authentication and state across the application.
- Created a simple login form with authentication using API context.

## Projects Developed
### 1. Simple Website with React Router
- Description: A multi-page website built using React Router, featuring navigation and dynamic routing.
  
### 2. GitHub Data Viewer
- Description: An application that fetches and displays GitHub user information and repositories.
  
### 3. Currency Converter
- Description: A currency converter application that fetches live exchange rates and performs conversions.
  
### 4. Login Form with API Context
- Description: A simple login form integrated with API context for user authentication.

## Challenges and Learnings
Throughout these nine days, I encountered various challenges, such as understanding routing concepts, handling asynchronous data fetching, and managing state with context API. However, through perseverance and consulting documentation and resources, I was able to overcome these challenges and deepen my understanding of React and its ecosystem.

## Future Plans
As I progress further in my React learning journey, I plan to explore more advanced topics such as state management libraries like Redux, server-side rendering with Next.js, and deploying React applications to production environments.
