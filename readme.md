# My React Learning Journey

## Day One: Getting Started with React

### Overview
Today marked the beginning of my journey into the world of React. I explored the fundamentals, including setting up React applications using two methods: the traditional `create-react-app` approach and the faster alternative, Vite. Additionally, I delved into understanding React's file structure, creating custom React applications, and grasping the concept of React Hooks.

### Key Learnings
- **Creating React Apps:**
  - Explored the traditional method using `npm create-react-app`.
  - Discovered the faster alternative, Vite, for creating React applications.
- **Understanding File Structures:**
  - Analyzed the differences in file structure between applications created by `create-react-app` and Vite.
- **Creating Custom React Apps:**
  - Learned how to create a custom React app from scratch.
  - Implemented basic functionality such as creating React elements and printing "Hello, World!" to the screen.
- **Understanding React Hooks:**
  - Explored the concept of React Hooks, starting with `useState`.
  - Practiced implementing a simple counter application, updating its state with `useState` to increase and decrease the counter.

### Future Steps
- Explore more React Hooks and their applications.
- Dive deeper into React's ecosystem and best practices.
- Continue building and experimenting with React applications to solidify understanding.
